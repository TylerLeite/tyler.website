		<p class="fade-in fade-pause">This is a website. Well, not really at this point. It'll come along though. Eventually. I even have things to put up, it's just a matter of cleaning everything up. I wouldn't want to be embarassed by sloppy code on my portfolio website, now would I? Anyway, I know I don't have a link here yet, which means you had to use some shenanigans to get here. Something like typing in the URL, or navigating here from my GitHub profile. Maybe you just took the URL from my resume and thought "Hey, <a class="hidden_link" target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/oTDdyJV.jpg">this guy</a> is really cool and <a class="hidden_link" target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/oTDdyJV.jpg">handsome</a>! I wonder what else this <a class="hidden_link" target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/oTDdyJV.jpg">dashing young man</a> has created...". At any rate, you put in effort, real effort, to get here. And what is there to show for it? Nothing. How embarassing for me, right? I really wouldn't want to disappoint you like that. I mean, we only just met! And honestly, I hate to give a bad first impression. So here, I guess I'll give you a sneak peak at something I've been tinkering with.</p>
		<p class="fade-in fade-pause">It's a random text generator. Basically, it takes a bunch of phonemes (the building blocks of words) and puts them together mostly randomly. By this method, it builds up a vocabulary and stores it in a "dictionary". It then picks words randomly from this dictionary and separates them with periods (full-stops) and commas (probably half-stops, maybe a little less). Behind the scenes, there are a bunch of variables that control things like average syllable count and lexical density. These variables make up a genome of sorts. The code that I have written so far is a set of instructions for how to express that genome. Big picture, this is going to be part of a project where I analyze text from a bunch of different languages to create a "genotype pool" and then make hybrid and imitation languages like some kind of mad scientist.</p>
