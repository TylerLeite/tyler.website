need a way to deal with at 1 / 8 / 10
need to pick note lengths
-breaks as passing tones?

want to evolve chord structure naturally + self-similarly
-> l system useful? could use a GA to fit an l-system-defined structure to the melody, use function line matches as fitness
-> keep track of tension value over time? as it rises, more dissonance is allowed (or even encouraged), as it drops, try to stay consonant
-> also excitement / emphasis: faster note speed / higher density of chord strikes

ui
accompany in real time
-listen through mic?
-set tension, excitement, emphasis based on what it hears
